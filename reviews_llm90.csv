"The author is complaining about receiving unsolicited calls from United American Insurance despite being on the ""do not call list."" The calls are pre-recorded messages left on their answering machine, and the author has no idea how the company obtained their phone number."
"The author has submitted multiple complaints about United American Insurance Company, including misrepresentation by a local branch manager and his superiors. The Texas and Georgia Departments of Insurance have not addressed the reported violations of state insurance laws. The author wrote to the Attorney General, but the Assistant Attorney General will not address their concerns. The author believes a class action lawsuit is necessary to resolve the issues. The author warns others to be cautious when dealing with this company. Damage resulted in $800 plus unpaid claims."

The author warns others to be cautious before buying from United American Insurance Company."
The author filed two complaints against United American for violating state insurance laws and unfair business practices. One of the complaints was published on the company's website. The author seeks exposure to these issues through media or other means to bring attention to the company and prompt a response.
"The author has had negative experiences with a branch manager, a VP, and a paralegal at an insurance company who have misled and made false promises. The state insurance office has not been helpful in protecting the consumer. The author suggests caution when dealing with this company and believes their case deserves media attention and possibly legal action."
"The author has had negative experiences with a company, including a branch manager who misled them into applying for a policy, a VP who did not show up for a scheduled visit, and a paralegal who promised to pay benefits but then refused.

"The author has had a negative experience with a company that misled them into applying for a policy, a VP who didn't show up for a scheduled visit, a paralegal who promised benefits but now refuses claims, and a state insurance office that sides with the company instead of the consumer. The author warns others to be cautious before buying from this company and highlights the unethical behavior of the branch manager, VP, paralegal, and state insurance department."
"The company in question has violated state insurance laws, allowed a manager to make unauthorized promises resulting in personal expenses, denied and failed to deliver on promises, refused to pay claims, and had a vice-president who did not show up for a meeting. The author strongly advises avoiding this company."
"The author purchased a Medicare supplemental insurance policy for those under 65, but the company has denied every claim submitted. The author's agent promised that the pre-existing condition clause would be waived with proof of an existing group plan, but the insurance company has not honored this agreement. The author's premiums increased by over 20% in the fourth month, and the agent has been caught in lies. The author is paying $4,800 per year for the insurance but has only received $230 in coverage. The author plans to cancel the policy."
"The writer was misled by an insurance agent who claimed their policy was like a PPO and could be used at any doctor's office, dentist, or pharmacy. However, when the writer tried to use the card at a doctor's office, they received a letter from United stating that the policy only covered accidental injuries and not illnesses. The writer believes the company is a scam and advises others to stay away."
"The policyholder had a colonoscopy, endoscopy, and gallbladder removal, but United American Insurance only paid out $200, which was much less than expected. The insurance company explained that they only pay out $200 annually on the policy, despite the high premiums. The policyholder believes the company is running a scam and advises others to avoid working with United American Insurance."
"The author complains about paying monthly premiums for insurance that denies most claims, including emergency room visits and cancer surgery. They question the point of paying for coverage that doesn't seem to cover anything."
"The author warns against working for United American, a company that promises high incomes but provides inadequate training and support. Agents are required to make a high volume of calls and sell a certain amount or risk being fired. The company hires and fires agents to avoid paying residuals, and the author believes the company is a scam that does not provide good coverage for clients."
"The author signed up for two insurance policies, one of which was supposed to provide ""GAP"" coverage. However, when they made their first claim for an emergency hospital visit, it was denied because it was considered an ""outpatient"" visit. The author was not informed of this when they purchased the policy and feels deceived. The insurance company suggested purchasing a rider to cover outpatient expenses, but the author rejects this as a ""bait-and-switch."" Additionally, the insurance company sent the author's ID cards to the correct address but not the explanation of benefits package due to an incorrect address."
"The writer contacted an insurance company for ""gap"" insurance but found out that they had certain restrictions and required automatic monthly deductions from their checking account, which the writer found unacceptable. The writer considers the company to be a scam and would not consider them again."
"The author had a negative experience with United American insurance, as they only paid a small portion of medical bills for skin and lung cancer treatments, leaving the author with a large amount of debt.

The author suggests reporting the company and filing a lawsuit to get their money back."
"The author is frustrated with their health insurance provider, American United Prescription, as they are paying $150+ a month for pain meds with their discount card and $300 a month for doctor visits. They are now $60,000 in debt and have judgements against them. The author was under the impression that the insurance would pay 80% up to $160 per doctor's visit, but this was not the case. They regret not researching the provider before signing up."
"Kenny offered better coverage to a couple who already had insurance with Mid-West. They were only interested in major medical due to being self-employed. Kenny claimed his insurance paid 80% and was a PPO. However, when the husband had a heart attack, the hospital bill was almost $90,000, but their insurance only paid a cap of $7,000 and $2,000 to the doctor, which was not mentioned before."
"The author paid their health insurance bill on time for almost three years, but every claim submitted by their doctors was denied. Despite paying over $35,000, the insurance company wouldn't even cover a $400 doctor's visit."
"The author worked for United American Insurance Company and was promoted quickly, but now realizes that the company hires anyone and most agents know nothing about insurance. The policies are written in obscure language and do not cover much. The author left the company and advises complaining to the state's Department of Insurance to effect change."
"The author purchased a United American policy for their family, believing it to be major medical insurance that covered 80% of major medical expenses. However, when the author's wife was in a serious accident and required hospital stays and surgery, United American only covered about $16K of the $80K bill. The author discovered that United American is not a major medical insurer and does not have insurance contracts with medical caregivers. The author warns against purchasing from United American and suggests a class action lawsuit."
"The author had shoulder surgery and used their insurance for the first time. The total bill was $17k, but the insurance only paid $5k, leaving a bill of $12k. The author paid $23k in premiums over the last three years and is still trying to understand why the insurance paid so little."
The author paid regular premiums of nearly $400/month to United American but only received $35 in coverage for a medical bill of around $700 due to a reaction to prescribed medication. The author believes United American is a scam artist and suggests policy holders should initiate a class action lawsuit.
"The insurance policy in question has failed to pay out as promised, despite the premiums being paid. The insurance company has blamed the doctor for filing the bills incorrectly, but even after resubmitting them, the bills remain unpaid. The author advises others to avoid this insurance if they require reliable coverage."
A hospital is refusing to pay for a routine thyroid test that costs $800. They are offering to settle at a lower amount of $550.56 by a specific date.
"The author received a letter from United American stating they would pay the full benefit amount of $4,000 on a hospital bill, but they only paid about $3,500. United American has denied multiple claims without explanation. The author and the hospital are currently fighting with United American to pay the remaining balance."
"The writer had United American Insurance but was misled about their coverage. The insurance only pays up to 80% of the amounts they will pay, not 80% of the bill. The writer's bill from the emergency room was $8000, but the insurance will only pay $349. The writer was advised to work out a payment plan with the hospital."
"The author was issued a medical supplement policy in 2005 by Chris Wilson, but later discovered that it included a 10-year life insurance policy for $70 a month. The author did not want life insurance and is confused as to how this happened. They feel it is a scam and do not understand how their signature and their husband's ended up on the policy."
"A couple discovered that United American had been taking $70 a month from their bank account since 2005, despite the fact that the husband's policy had been cancelled. The wife believes they owe her $2,380. The couple are seniors on Social Security and have also been victims of bank fraud."
"A woman with a policy from another insurance company was approached by a representative from a different company who claimed they could offer better coverage for less money. The woman switched to the new company, but when she needed coverage for cancer treatment, her claims were denied and the representative, Laura Fisher Weaver, would not return calls. The company eventually sent an itemized statement of payments, but still did not respond to further inquiries."
"The author paid $300 per month for a couple of years to United American but never made a claim until his wife was diagnosed with an illness that required extensive treatment. Despite being told that the treatment would be covered at 80%, the insurance company only paid out $300 and refused to pay more. The author paid around $7000, but the insurance company only paid out $300, and the policy did not mention the additional charges."
"The text describes a scam by United American Insurance (UA) where they promised high commissions to a husband who signed up friends, family, co-workers, and former clients. However, when policies were received, they were rated down, and UA took full premiums, claiming the husband had to pay back clients. When some policies were stopped due to reduced insurance amounts, UA cancelled all policies and kept the full premiums. The husband no longer works for UA, and a complaint has been made to the DOI in Nevada. UA operates under different names and is a scam."
"The company in question falsely claimed that pre-existing conditions would not affect their health insurance coverage, leading to numerous denials of coverage. The author is seeking a full refund of premiums paid and believes the company should be investigated legally. Surgery was accepted based on the false assurance of coverage, but has since been denied."
"The author had a bad experience with United American Insurance (UAI), who took money from their account at random times and in varying amounts. The author's sales lady promised to fix the issue, but it was not resolved. UAI started sending paper bills instead of taking money from the author's account, but they still claimed the author owed them money. The author is frustrated and feels that UAI is stealing from people who trust them."
"The writer purchased a policy that was supposed to pay 80% of hospital bills, but when her husband was admitted, they only paid 5% without explanation. A unit manager said the plan should have paid all but 20%, but the writer hasn't heard back from the company. As a result, the writer's husband has been turned over to collections and his credit has been ruined."
"The author was hired by United American to sell insurance, but quickly realized the company was unethical. They were asked to obtain a license and promised reimbursement, but were not paid until after making sales. The author's trainer was dishonest and took half their commission. The author was fired for being ""negative"" and not given their final paycheck. The company has a history of mistreating agents and lying to customers. The author apologizes for any harm caused and questions how the company treats its customers."
"The problem with health insurance is that the contracts between insurers and providers can be weak or non-existent, leading to denied benefits and unexpected costs for patients. Providers may deny negotiated discounts, even if they are in the contract, by treating each line item on the bill as a separate contract. Patients have no legal right to know beforehand what negotiated discounts they will receive. The author's hospital bill was $7,500, but they received a 10% discount and paid $2,200, which is still $1,600 more than if they had Blue Cross. These principles will apply to future bills."
"The writer met with sales reps from United American Insurance Company to obtain health insurance for a culinary arts program required by their college. They were misled into purchasing a discount program instead of actual health insurance, which does not meet the college's requirements. The writer has paid for three months of this program and is concerned about the misrepresentation made by the sales reps. They have requested cancellation but have already lost $133.95 per month in premiums and are unable to participate in the college program due to lack of proper health insurance."
"The author bought a Medigap policy in 1997 for $60 a month, but now pays $195 a month due to annual premium increases. They only bought outpatient coverage, not hospital coverage, and have been overcharged for years. The author has contacted the State Insurance board but has received no help. They are looking for assistance in getting rebates and punishing the insurance company for stealing from their Social Security income."
"The writer has been paying almost $400 a month for what they thought was health insurance, only to find out that it doesn't cover appointments, prescriptions, ER visits, or overnight stays. They now have an $11,000 hospital bill and are considering filing a class action lawsuit against the company. The customer service representative was unhelpful and laughed at the writer's situation. The writer plans to contact the state attorney's office."
"The writer purchased a United American Insurance policy for hospitalization, but after being hospitalized for bilateral total knee replacement surgery and complications, they found out the policy only covers up to $8,000 per occurrence. Their bill is over $120,000 and the major medical insurance plan is only paying $8,000. The writer warns others to beware of United American Insurance."
"The author purchased what they believed was health insurance and made monthly payments, but when they filed a claim, the insurance company did not pay. The agent, Jerry, was unhelpful and made excuses. The author is now arranging payments directly with the hospital to cover the claim."
"An agent with United American Insurance Company claims to have been sexually harassed and discriminated against by management. The agent has an attorney and hopes that others will not be targeted for standing up to the company. The agent was retaliated against by holding renewals and agent statements and was called a peasant by management despite writing $250,000 in annual apr for them. The agent is afraid for customers due to false training on coverage."
"The author posted their resume online and received an email from American Income, which led to a phone call and the sharing of personal information. Later, they received an email from United American Insurance with a similar phone number and realized it was likely the same company. Upon researching the company, they found similar complaints and learned that the job offered was commission-based with no salary or hourly wage. The author advises against wasting time contacting this company."
"The United American Insurance policy purchased by a family was supposed to cover doctor visits, emergency room visits, and CAT scans up to $3,000. However, the policy did not cover emergency room visits without overnight stays, and the family was not informed of this. The insurance company also did not cover claims made by the family and raised their rates. As a result of an emergency room visit for their son, the family is now ineligible for HMO insurance and is struggling financially. The insurance company misrepresented itself and put the family in a precarious financial situation."
"The author had an expensive Blue Cross policy with a $5,000 deductible, but decided to switch to a new policy that assured them it would not be a coverage issue despite their pre-existing conditions. However, they later found out that there was no prescription coverage and they would not be covered for 180 days due to their pre-existing conditions. They gave up their previous insurance for no coverage and their premiums increased after 9 months by $153.71, higher than any Blue Cross increase they had incurred."
"The writer's health insurance only covers $300 for outpatient services, leading to unpaid bills for an MRI and physical therapy. The writer had to cancel appointments and now cannot afford to go to a doctor for back and leg pain."
"The author had a bad experience with United American Insurance after being diagnosed with kidney infection and kidney stones. The insurance company only paid $300 on the first bill and nothing on the second, claiming that they only pay once per diagnosis. The author believes that United American Insurance is running a scam and advises others to avoid it. The author also had to set up a payment plan with the hospital to pay the bills."
"The writer's wife signed up for what she thought was an affordable health insurance plan offered by UAI, but it turned out to be a secondary insurance for those who already have primary insurance. The plan only covered up to $2,000 a day, despite the representative emphasizing that it covered 80% of medical bills. The writer and his wife were left with almost $30,000 in medical bills and no solution from UAI. They are now without insurance and facing financial difficulties."
"The writer was misled by their insurance agent and found out that their policy covered very little. They and their colleagues had similar issues and cancelled their policies. Despite having bills of over $6,000, United American Insurance only paid $300. The writer considers the company a scam."
"The writer received a sales pitch for an insurance service that claimed to be accepted at any doctor's office or hospital. However, they have had trouble finding participating offices and have not received satisfactory answers from the company when they called with questions. The writer ended up going to the emergency room and is concerned about the resulting bill. They share their experience as a cautionary tale for others considering the service."
"The author has had a negative experience with a company, stating that they have been lied to and that the company took 14 months to process something. The company is now avoiding paying another claim."
"The author used to process insurance applications for United American and noticed that many clients complained about the lack of a working customer service number. One client had a negative experience with an agent who withdrew funds prematurely, causing her to miss a car payment deadline. The author sympathizes with those who have been swindled by the company."
"United American failed to pay a $4000 hospital bill, claiming the test performed in the emergency room was not covered by their policy. They did not inform the patient until the bill was turned over to a collection agency six months later. United American said they were trying to get the bill adjusted, but never gave a straight answer about the status of the claim. The patient is now responsible for paying the bill."
"A company is sending out misleading mass mailings that simulate US government or Social Security mailings during the Medicare Part-D signup window, causing confusion among senior citizens who may contemplate changing their coverage under the impression that the government is telling them to do so."
"The author applied for United American Insurance in 2006 for preventative doctor visits and prescriptions. They were promised a discount prescription that would lower their medicine cost from $55 to $15 a month, but it only took $1.50 off. They were paying $4 extra a month and decided to switch from United American."
"A misleading letter was sent to a non-English speaker from what appeared to be Medicare, but was actually from United American Insurance Co. The letter carried a warning about the May 15 Part D deadline and included a detailed application for Medicare Part D insurance. The letter was sent by express and not by US mail, and was designed to deceive the recipient into thinking it was from Medicare."
"A customer of United American insurance complains of being deceived by an agent who promised more coverage for less money than their previous insurer, Blue Cross. The customer received a bill for $3000, of which UA paid only $447, leaving the customer responsible for the remainder. The customer has been unable to contact the agent since obtaining the policy and suspects deception in the sales pitch."
"The author signed up for insurance with United American after being approached by two gentlemen in a store. They spent over $3,100 on prescriptions and doctor fees, but found out that nothing was covered by the insurance. The author was frustrated and felt scammed, and when they tried to cancel, United American still tried to deduct payment from their bank account."
"The author obtained insurance through UA in 2004, but has had numerous problems with the policy. They were misled by the agent and were never properly informed about the riders, rules, and exceptions. They were surprised to find out that the $500 well visit max included vaccinations, resulting in a $788 balance to pay out of pocket. The policy also did not cover sick visits regularly and the dental insurance turned out to be a discount program. The author cancelled UA due to these issues and the added expenses have put a strain on their one income household."
"An elderly man with an accent like Texas came to the writer's home to sell health insurance. When the writer asked for the name of the company, the man refused to tell and became aggressive when the writer said they would check with their doctor and hospital. The writer suspected the man was a fraud and reported him to the sheriff. The man's papers mentioned United American."
"The author was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002 and has a hospital bill of $20,000, of which United American paid only $100. They also have a medical bill from Oschner Hospital and Clinic totaling $105,000. The author has been unable to work due to their health and has recently started receiving SSI after being denied twice. They have applied for Medicaid but the Ochsner Clinic only accepts Medicare."
"An advanced practicing nurse had her claim for a screen colonoscopy denied by United Health One due to incorrect coding. Despite assuring them it was coded correctly and reviewing the surgeon's report, the insurance company continued to deny the claim. The nurse plans to file a lawsuit and is inviting others to join her in a class action lawsuit for claims denied due to ""improper coding."" She believes these insurance companies are scam artists who deserve to be put in prison."
"A warning not to sign up with a certain company if you have Medicare, as the author has had issues with them not receiving pre-authorization for medication despite multiple attempts from the doctor and even a phone call. The issue only pertains to narcotic or psych meds, and the author plans to switch to a better supplement like AARP."
The author has been unable to access their account despite entering the correct password and verifying their identity with a code sent to their phone. The security cannot be verified and the chat service is useless. The author is frustrated with the situation and does not have time to sit on hold all day.
"The author has been unsuccessful in obtaining the 2023 fee schedule despite multiple attempts through various means of communication. This has resulted in their inability to update and complete the fee schedule, causing disappointment."
"The dental and prescription coverage is good, but the vision and medical coverage need improvement. The highest level of coverage was purchased, but all specialists cost $80. The insurance company, UHC, encourages the use of virtual appointments or urgent care. Biopsies are considered surgeries and are subject to the high deductible. Customer service is good, but the appeal was denied. Overall, the reviewer considers this insurance to be one of the worst they have had."
"The text warns against using All Savers Insurance for employees, citing poor coverage for diabetics and rude representatives. The author advises looking for alternative options or considering self-pay."
"The author has had United for years but in January, they outsourced approvals to Evicore, who denies everything and makes patients appeal. United is using them as a scapegoat for denials. The author has had meds and procedures denied, including an MRI because they haven't been to therapy for at least 6 weeks. Envicore advised the author to have the doctor complete the appeals process correctly. United blames Evicore who then blames the doctors."
"The author paid for COBRA to avoid Obamacare, but ended up with United Healthcare through the Marketplace. They had issues with customer service and received conflicting information about their plan, leading to confusion about whether a mammogram was covered. They later found out it was not covered and received a bill for past premiums despite being on auto-pay. The author is disillusioned with United Healthcare and looking forward to switching to Medicare."
"The author and her husband have a high family deductible and individual deductible, making it difficult for her to afford necessary surgery for severe health issues, despite a history of heart attacks and stroke. The surgery is not covered and she cannot afford to pay for it."
"The insurance company prioritizes saving money over providing quality care, denying coverage after stroke events and expecting patients to pay for medical care. Denial claims are worded to benefit the company's bottom line, and requiring progress before continuing coverage is counterproductive. The company fails to provide quality care when it is most needed and should be investigated."
The author regrets switching to United Health Care Advantage due to their poor customer service. They struggle to get through to representatives who speak broken English and have filed a complaint with Medicare.
"The author changed their Medicare insurance to UHC but has had a terrible experience. They haven't received their member card after 45 days and have had issues with gym membership, eyecare coverage, and drug plans. The customer service is poor and the author regrets their decision to switch to UHC."
"The author switched their drug plan to UHC from Humana and regrets it. Some of their drugs are not covered and UHC's formulary offers an alternative drug that is not a generic. To get the original prescription, the physician needs to submit a ""prior authorization."" The author had trouble communicating with UHC's customer service and was disconnected when transferred to a US representative. They were also told not to call back if disconnected due to the volume of calls received. The author plans to switch back to Humana."
"The author joined a UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage Plan in January 2023 but has had a disappointing experience. Customer advocates are located in another country and have not been trained, resulting in reps who cannot answer simple questions. The author has had problems with their ID/U Card and has been waiting for a fourth card due to errors. The website and app do not work properly. The author is considering changing to another plan with another company due to the poor service received from UnitedHealthcare."
"The UHC UCard has caused frustration for a customer who received multiple cards with incorrect information and bar codes that didn't work. The online bill pay system also has incorrect information and doesn't allow manual entry. Customer service agents are incompetent and unprofessional, intentionally making things difficult for customers. The customer suspects collusion with Walmart for bill payments to collect fees and frustrate seniors. Overall, the UCard is not a good benefit."
"The author has been a UHC customer for 5 years but is frustrated with their customer service, which has gone overseas. They have had trouble understanding the representatives and getting clear answers about their benefits. The author gives an example of a diagnostic procedure and how they were given conflicting information about their copay and percentage of payment. The author plans to switch insurance providers due to the frustration with UHC's customer service."
"The author purchased glasses that were approved by United Health Care, but ended up receiving a bill four times higher than their portion. UHC only paid $112.86 out of the $487.00 bill, despite their website stating coverage up to $200. The author warns others to call UHC before purchasing glasses, as there may be hidden costs and lack of clarity in coverage. The author is now stuck paying $312.30 for a pair of glasses they were told would cost $67.00."
"The speaker had to repeat themselves multiple times to an agent who didn't understand them well, and was put back in the queue when they tried to give a rating."

"The author has not received their U card after 6 weeks and has had poor experiences with customer service, including being given misleading information and not being provided with automatic review options. They have also had difficulty speaking with supervisors and have encountered robotic responses. The service has been inefficient and has not been able to issue a duplicate card despite multiple promises to do so. It has been 7 weeks and the author has still not received their card."
"The author had a short term disability policy with United Healthcare, but when they needed to make a claim, the company refused to pay. The author had to request forms multiple times, and when their doctor filled them out, the representative rejected them because the date of absence was incorrect. The author needed the income to pay for ongoing treatment and health insurance. The author advises against choosing United Healthcare, as they delay and make the process difficult, ultimately denying claims and blaming the policyholder."
"The writer's prescription cost was raised from $50 to $500 by UHC to force them to use their online pharmacy, Optum. After a week of trying to transfer the prescription, they found out that Optum didn't even have the medicine in stock. The writer is now two weeks without their medicine and is at risk of going to the ER every day. The writer believes UHC is using extortion tactics and represents everything wrong with the healthcare system."
"The United Health Care OTC program has poor customer service representatives who lack English proficiency and comprehensive abilities, prompting the author to switch to another service."
"United Healthcare falsely lists doctors as in-network, rejects claims, and provides inadequate customer service. Patients are left to resolve paperwork issues and appeals on their own, with a dead link to the appeal form on their website. The author advises those in New Jersey to file a complaint with a specific organization."
"The transition to COBRA coverage for a Type 1 diabetic was a nightmare, with the insurance company making it difficult to file claims and obtain medical supplies. They required clinical notes and pre-authorization, despite there being no cure for Type 1 diabetes. The insurance company even needed new doctor information to approve supplies that had been previously approved for years."
"The author has not received results for a colon cancer test from United Healthcare's vendor lab, despite contacting them multiple times and updating their address. The author has notified the CEO and invited a response to their review."
"The 1-866 customer service number is ineffective, with agents lacking the skills to answer questions. The author was given inaccurate information about their Medicare Advantage plan's coverage for dental procedures at out-of-network dentists. The supervisor understood the complaint about agents providing incorrect information but did not offer a solution."
"The author advises against using United Healthcare due to their pharmacy benefit manager's refusal to fill a prescription, despite the author's accounts being current. The author was able to get the prescription filled at a local retail pharmacy instead."
The author has been having difficulty understanding the people who answer the phones at UHCare's pharmacy and believes they need to improve their English speaking skills.
"The United Healthcare prescription plan endorsed by AARP does not cover a commonly prescribed blood thinner, Eliquis, which costs over $450 per month. This is a disappointment for seniors who rely on AARP's representation and raises questions about the plan's standards."
"The writer's request for medication was denied by a doctor they do not know, based on the insurance company's policy of trying a cheaper drug first. The writer must now appeal the decision, despite having no other options through their employer. The writer criticizes the insurance company for being greedy and unregulated."
"The author had an overpriced short-term health plan which they wanted to cancel after getting insurance through employment. However, the provider refused to cancel before the prepaid date, resulting in the author having to double pay for health insurance for a month with no refund. The author considers this to be theft and advises others to stay away from this provider."
"The author strongly advises against using United Denial No Care, claiming that they denied every claim for over a year and do not care about their customers' health. The author warns that choosing this service could lead to bankruptcy and accuses them of being a scam."

They express frustration with surprise billing and the company's failure to fulfill financial obligations. The author suggests discontinuing insurance and warns others to stay away from United Health Care.
"The writer had a bad experience with a contact lens company that required them to return each faulty lens before getting a refund, which was difficult for daily lenses. The policy was unreasonable and discouraged returns, and the writer no longer recommends the company."
"The author met their deductible and out-of-pocket minimum for 2022, but UnitedHealthcare (UHC) added an increase to their deductible and out-of-pocket max for next year to their totals for this year, which won't apply for next year.
